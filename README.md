# Power-BI---Data-Analytics
Twitter Data Analytics 

This Power BI dashboard is built as a part of NullClass Internship project. This Report depicts the analysis of the Twitter data having approx. 1000 rows of data. It focuses on key metrics such as impressions, clicks (URL clicks, user profile clicks, hashtag clicks), and engagements. By analyzing data from various perspectivesâ€”such as time of posting, tweet content, and engagement levels, I was able to uncover patterns and trends that provide valuable insights into how different types of tweets perform.
